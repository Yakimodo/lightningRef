              git clone _name of repository_

(2) 

Make update to ref.bib with text editor of your choice and save.

(3)

Type "git diff" and hit Enter to check that you typed everything properly

(4)

Type "git status" and hit Enter to see if ref.bib was indeed modified

(5) 

Then add your changes by typing "git add -A". Hit Enter.

(6) 

Then type "git commit -m "message". In the message, write the author(etAl)_year_ of all the papers you added.

(7) 

Type "git pull origin main" and hit Enter.

Type "git push origin main" and hit Enter.
